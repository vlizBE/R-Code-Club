Were you worried about the next monthly R Code Club newsletter? You can breath again, here it is! Let's have a look at what did the Vlizers do with R lately.

### **Measuring the citation impact of our data systems**

We kept squeezing our schedules to have a look at how to create the citation App. We found a platform which looks quite promising: [Dimensions](https://www.dimensions.ai/). It gives citations, the relative citation ratio and the field citation ratio. They provide web services despite there is not an R package yet, but a python library. Maybe the brand new PyClub has something to say? `r emo::ji("wink")`

In any case, we can create our own R package! But we can also contact the community of R packages developers and ask if they have one for Dimensions.

### **Intro to dplyr**

Our colleague Thomas gave an introduction to the use of the tidyverse package [dyplr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/). Dplyr stands for dataset pliers. This is a package to handle data. It provides functions that correspond to the most common ways of analyzing data.

Dplyr works with [tibbles](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/), which is an improvement of traditional [data frames](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.1/topics/data.frame). For example, Tibble never changes the input type or the name of a variable. A subset of a tibble is always a tibble, while a subset of a data frame column is often a vector.

Also, one of the most popular features of Dplyr is the [pipe operator](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/) '&>&'. This feeds the following function with the output with the previous one, which is good to avoid the need of calling again the dataset or making nested queries. 

For example, have a look at the table below built from the dataset 'flights' of the package [lnycflights13](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nycflights13/index.html). Here, we filter by month and day, we order the data by scheduled departure time in descenct order and we finally show the 6 first rows with head - Everything in a single line!

```{r setup1, include=TRUE, results='hide', echo=TRUE}
  flights %>% filter(month == 4,day == 12) %>% arrange(desc(sched_dep_time)) %>% head()
```


```{r dplyr example, include=TRUE}

flights %>% select(1:10)  %>%      
  filter(month==4,day==12) %>%
  arrange(desc(sched_dep_time)) %>% head() %>% kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("condensed"))
```

There is a [dplyr course in datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-manipulation-with-dplyr-in-r), really recommended to learn this framework!

### **Tidy Tuesdays**

This is a weekly data project just to build up skills. Every Monday, a new dataset is posted and the community create any kind of projects with it. There is a [github repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).

Some examples below:

[Walking vs Cycling (to work)](https://twitter.com/chucc900/status/1192009972659286016)

### **R code club internship**

We created an [internship proposal](https://www.thesis.ugent.be/node/3166) for MSc students to join us for two months and help us out with tasks related to the R Code Club. Spreading the word and tasks proposals are very welcomed! `r emo::ji("pray")`


&nbsp;

### **#30DayMapChallenge**

This [challenge](https://twitter.com/hashtag/30daymapchallenge) consisted in creating a new map every day during one month. Every day the topic was different. Our colleague Brit created this beautiful fish tracking map. Enjoy!

### `r emo::ji("Christmas")` **New year, new topics** 

It is time to discuss what will be the following topics during the next year of the R Code Club. Have a look at the confluence page to see some of the topics we mentioned, but don't hesitate to jump into the discussion and feed us with your ideas!

These and more topics will be discussed the next 2019-12-06 at 14:00 CET in the [meeting room Marmara](https://goo.gl/maps/84nY6un5qGDyv3Mr9)

```{r map, out.width = '100%', out.height= 250, eval=FALSE}
# Something went wrong, it doesnt knit. Possible overlapping with another package.
library(leaflet)
leaflet(width = "100%") %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  setView(lng = 2.930397, lat = 51.232782, zoom = 16) %>%
  addMarkers(lng = 2.930397, lat = 51.232782, popup = "Meeting room IODE TR1")
```
