### **Measuring the citation impact of our data systems**

We kept squizing our schedules to have a look at how to create our citation App. We found a website called dimensions which looks quite promising! It can give citations, relative citation ratio or field citation ratio. They provide web services despite there is not an R package yet, but a python library :(

However this is none of a problem, cause we can create our own R package! But we can also contact people who do packages and ask if they have one for Dimensions.

### **Intro to dplyr**

Our colleague Thomas gave an introduction to the use of the tidyverse dyplr. Dplyr stands for dataset aplyr?. This is a package to handle data. It provides functions that correspond to the most common ways of analysing data.

Works with tibbles, which is an improvement of the data.frame: Why? it never changes the input type, does not change the variable name, a subset is always a tibble, never a vector or a data frame.

Shift + Alt + K opens a list of shorcuts.

The pipeline is one of the most famous characteristics of dplyr: it feeds the following function with the output with the previous one, which is good to avoid the need of calling again the dataset and making nested queries easier to understand.

```{r setup1, include=TRUE, results='hide'}
flights%>%         
  filter(month==4,day==12) %>%
  arrange(desc(sched_dep_time)) %>% head()
```


```{r dplyr example, include=TRUE}

flights%>%         
  filter(month==4,day==12) %>%
  arrange(desc(sched_dep_time)) %>% head() %>% kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))
```

There is a dplyr course in datacamp, really recomended to learn this framework!

### **  **

This is a weekly data project just to build up skills. They have a github repository with all the projects.

Some examples are the NYC squirrel census or the horror movies rating. 

There is also a podcast

it can be a good example of how other people did things

### **R code club internship**

We created an internship proposal 


&nbsp;

### **R Code Club Newsletter**

The R Code Club newsletter is being written using RMarkdown. This framework allow to create documents using both the markdown writing syntax and code chunks (and not only R! Also SQL, Python...). The RMarkdown projects can be exported as a word document, pdf (using LaTeX) or as an html file. 

Inside the [R Code Club github repository](https://github.com/vlizBE/R-Code-Club) you can find this newsletter. Feel free to have a look and play around!

&nbsp;

### ** Code style**

It is important to use good style for writing code. 

library styler, set the style as you want

```{r map, out.width = '100%', out.height= 250}
library(leaflet)
leaflet(width = "100%") %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  setView(lng = 2.930397, lat = 51.232782, zoom = 16) %>%
  addMarkers(lng = 2.930397, lat = 51.232782, popup = "Meeting room IODE TR1")
```
